## Tasks

1. test the application and report any bugs you can find.
2. write out some test scenarios so you can organize test runs every time we want to deploy a new version of the app.
3. try to automate (some of) these scenarios.

## Test cases

Due to the bug/uncertainty of expected behavior, I will assume all integers as valid inputs.

### Positive test cases

Submit integer value at lower boundary [0]
Submit integer value at lower boundary+1 [1]
Submit integer value within the range of [170-990]
Submit integer value higher than 991 [2000]

### Negative test cases

Submit a number with a decimal point
Submit a negative number
Submit a number in exponent notation
Submit a string
